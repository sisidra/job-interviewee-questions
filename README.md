# Interviewee Questions

// EARLY 

Job interviews go both ways!

Questions (ideas) to ask back to the interviewer.

Goal is to gain information about the company - policies, culture, mindset. Not to sound smart, but to gain information.

We do not want to end up in soul-sucking cubicle (unless we are desperate at this point in our lives).

As always - judge reaction, amount of vague and evasive language, etc.

# Possible Questions

* Would you compare your work culture closer to Google or Accenture?

* Does your company have a github (or similar) organization account or do you contribute back to OSS you use? Can you tell me about the OSS contribution policies?
